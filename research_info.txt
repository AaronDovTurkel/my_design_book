        -> "general" tasks (linked to all accounts)
        -> for each client
    -> tag each comment picture client to multiple places (so could see in different environments... i.e. general to-do's)

    -> can tag ppl, projects, and sub-projects on calendar events  
    -> each person has display profile for explore page 
        -> unique type of display profile for each member type
