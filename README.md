<p align="center">Welcome to <a href="https://afternoon-cove-68012.herokuapp.com/">"My Design Book"</a>, a hub for streamlining home design for both designers and home owners alike.</p>

## Usage

At the current beta stage our app allows you to store pictures in an easy-to-use filing system. Try creating a new home; or maybe a room; and then add a couple of new pictures! (Please use open sourced images. You can try copying the images from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">here</a>).
<br>
1. Located at the top right of the page you will find our "list tab".
  * From here you can select the home and room you would like to view and/or edit. 
  * To delete a picture, home, or room: simply click on the "x" button.
  * If you click and hold on a home or room name, you will be taken to our editing window. Just type your new name and hit  "submit" to make a change.
  
2. Clicking on the profile image on the top left of the page will bring you back to the main image viewer. 

## Road Map

<p align="center">"My Design Book" is in its humble beginnings but has lofty goals. We hope to make waves in the design world by creating a socially adept system for designers to find home owners and visa versa. Not only will this app connect people but it will also be the home base for all design needs. Whether you would like to set up a calendar, send an invoice, or store room dimensions "My Design Book" will have it all.</p>
